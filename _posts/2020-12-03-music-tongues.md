[Paula White's sermon for Trump's re-election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUmMUmLYT1Y&ab_channel=EntertainmentToday) was an odd sight for those not familiar with certain flavours of Christianity which speak in tongues. It was probably an odd sight for many who are familiar. In high school, we had a teacher who asserted he spoke in tongues, although I don't recall anyone seeing him do so first hand. I remember feeling embarrassed that someone took speaking in tongues seriously, and was confident enough to tell a group of teenagers. 

There are reasons to critique speaking in tongues, but one critique is that it is silly or childish. By speaking in tongues, you have given evidence that you are less-than-rational, by doing a less-than-rational thing. I think this critique is hypocritical, because we all like music, which seems very similar indeed. More importantly, for the great majority of us, we enjoy the sound of music, without explicitly knowing what is being said. For those who know explicitly what is being said (or how it is constructed), it's enjoyable because of the way it sounds. 

Speaking in tongues seems like a subset of music, or perhaps both are just similar subsets of communicating. Both are ways of communicating things that aren't well captured by words. Even when words are used, they are used to set the tone or to emphasise the tone. Music is now a very low cost mechanism to access a different emotional state, or access a previous emotional state. Speaking in tongues does this too.

Of course, I suspect the reason people actually critique speaking in tongues, is because it is an out-group phenomenon, and because people are ultimately slabs of anxious meat, who don't have any particular motivation to risk the acceptance of out-group phenomena. Marking it as silly or childish is just a way to not investigate that thought further.
