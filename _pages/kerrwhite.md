The "Kerr White report" is formally known as the 'Independent review of research and educational requirements for public health and tropical health in Australia'. It is an important report which has influenced the development of public health in Australia, but unfortunately can be quite tricky to obtain. I decided to convert the majority of the report's content to text for those who might find it useful.

I do not own the rights to this publication. 
Currently, there is a link to the PDF of this report [available here](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/C66647AAB9871405CA257BF000209A71/$File/pherp-review-1986.pdf).

## Summary of Recommendations 
[Return to Table of Contents](#back)

### I. Australia's Bicentennial Health Initiative
As Australia prepares to celebrate its bicentennial, this should be an opportune time to build on past accomplishments in order to create a "healthier" future. The following set of recommendations should be seen as a "package". Some of the initiatives are already reflected in the priorities and initial re-organisation of the Commonwealth Department of Health, others have been undertaken by several universities and health departments in the States, still others have been discussed at conferences and in more detail by smaller groups and a few have been canvassed for a decade or more in various forums. In many ways there is little new in the essential elements. What will be new is their introduction as a collection of related initiatives designed to move Australia's health enterprise into the twenty-first century. 

### II. Australian Academy of Health
__RECOMMENDATION:__ To elevate the level of debate and provide timely consideration for the country's national health problems an Australian Academy of Health should be established. A Task Force should be appointed to draft legislation procedures and a budget for creating a national membership body of about 150-200 individuals, forty percent would be non-health professionals. A full-time President and staff would work with an unpaid Governing Council, Committees and Task Forces to examine and make recommendations on a wide variety of health problems and issues. The initial budget might be \\$1.5 million annually.

### III. Australian Institute of Health
This innovative approach towards information-based policy analysis and decision-making is highly commendable. It has been given, however, an unusually broad mandate, inadequately defined responsibilities and ambiguous relationships to the Commonwealth and State Governments and to universities, varying time frames for reporting, and a current agenda inherited from disparate predecessor bodies. The substantial conceptual advances represented by the creation of the AIH should now be clarified and strengthened and to that end, the following three recommendations are made

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The AIH should be strengthened by giving it a more clearly defined role as the substantial policy analysis and "intelligence" group working directly for the Minister and Secretary. It should be in a staff, not a line, position and would work closely with the entities proposed in the next two recommendations. It should have a Director and staff of perhaps 6 to 8 professionals with appropriate support personnel. The initial budget should be \\$0.5 million annually.

### IV. National Centre for Health Statistics
__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Centre for Health Statistics to provide leadership and co-ordination of compatible and comparable Health Statistics Systems for the entire country should be established by legislation. The Centre would promulgate standards, conventions, terms, definitions, minimum data sets and classifications and should contract with States, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and survey organisations for data collection. It is especially important that cost, charges and financial statistics be linked with those measuring needs, resources, use and outcomes. The NCHS would publish substantive and methodological reports including an annual report entitled "Health Australia: 19--". The Centre should be, and be seen to be non-political, under the Commonwealth Department of Health for administrative purposes only, and serving the entire nation by reporting to the Australian Health Services Council. The initial budget might be \\$2.0 million annually. 

### V. National Centre for Technology and Health Services Assessment
__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Centre 'for Technology and Health Services Assessment should be established by, legislation. It would be responsible for developing methods and undertaking studies designed to assess the outcome of health services of all types including both individual and collective interventions. It would conduct health services research including cost-effectiveness studies of both new and current technologies, utilization of health, hospital and pharmaceutical services of all types. Particular attention should be paid to low-cost, high-volume diagnostic tests, procedures and prescriptions as well as to capital-intensive technologies. The Centre would not be responsible for testing the safety and toxicity of drugs but it would be responsible for studies of their patterns of use and their cost-effectiveness. The Centre should be, and be seen to be non-political, under the Commonwealth Department of Health for administrative purposes only, and serving the entire nation by reporting to the Australian Health Services Council. The initial annual budget might be \\$1.5 million annually. 

### VI. School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine
The consensus of the great majority of submissions and opinions expressed during interviews, and at the Sydney Seminar is that the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine has out lived its usefulness. Multiple reviews over the past decade or more have been unable to help the school to define its mission,recruit permanent leadership or have an observable impact on contemporary health affairs in the country. Dual masters for funding, leadership and performance, ambiguous organisational relationships, rapid turnover of faculty, conflicts between goal-oriented and investigator-initiated research, incompatible mixes of students, use of the courses primarily for purposes of job advancement, uncoordinated lectures by visiting office holders, variable academic standards, inability to at tract many young students, an uneven research output, uneasy tension with the medical faculty, limited administrative support from the medical faculty, discordance between school priorities and perceived national problems are among the many manifestations said to be associated with the widespread perception of inadequacy. It is a sad litany and there is no point in attempting to apportion blame. 

There are first-rate people in the school and their dedication  during a protracted period of uncertainty is applauded. The talents of these highly skilled and committed individuals constitute a valuable national resource and opportunities should. be provided for them as soon as possible in new venues where a fresh start is to be made. There are occasions in t.he lives of institutions and organisations when revitalisation and renewal are only possible under new auspices. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ All the funds and resources currently devoted to the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine should be redeployed for new institutional and organisational initiatives that further the goals of- public and tropical health throughout Australia. 

### VII. Institutional Arrangements for Public Health Education
__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Research Centre for Epidemiology  and Population Health should be established at the Australian National University. A director who is preferably an epidemiologist with wet laboratory and/or clinical experience and managerial expertise should be chosen by the University on the basis of an international competition. The initial disciplines to be incLuded on the Centre's Faculty in addition to epidemiology should include health statistics, sociology, economics, nutrition and toxicology. The principal task of this research centre should be the graduate education to M.Sc and Ph.D levels of academic faculty in t.he major disciplines germane to public and tropical health especially epidemiology. An annual budget of about \\$2 million should be transferred from the Commonwealth Department of Health t.0 the ANU vote and this should be provided for six years. The initial budget would probably include about. \\$1 million for a new building. The director and an initial staff of eight. to ten faculty should have five-year term appointments to be followed by an external review and further renewals or tenure as circumstances warrant. ANU should incorporate the Research Centre's budget in it.s global budget after the initial six year period. Additional research funds should be sought from the NHEMRC's, Health Research Committee and its Health Development Committee, (see below) private foundations and voluntary agencies.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ At least. \\$4.0 million annually should be
provided by the Commonwealth department of Health t.o endow or fund chairs, senior lecturers' and lecturer positions principally at three universities that provide both strong undergraduate and postgraduate education in public health or related fields, have recently had infusions of new funds or support and are prepared to give an MPH or preferably M.Sc or Ph.D degrees. The universities proposed initially are The University of Adelaide, The University of Sydney's new initiative at Westmead Hospital and The University of Newcastle.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ At least \\$1.0 million annually should be provided by the Commonwealth Department of Health for salaries of faculty and support personnel at universities (other than those nominated above) and colleges of advanced education that provide strong undergraduate and post-graduate education in public health or related fields.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ About 50 scholarships should be provided annually through a national competition arranged and assessed by the Health Development Committee (see below) of the NHGMRC. These should have a value of about \\$30,000 each annually and they would be used for support of training in the various disciplines germane to public health, including management. About \\$2.0 million annually might be needed for this initiative.

### VIII. National Health and Medical Research Council
__RECOMMENDATION:__ The Medical Research Committee should change its title to reflect what it says it does and become the Health Research Committee (HRC). Of its seventeen members, it should have at least four of its total membership and at least two of its eight "medical researchers", who are experienced and competent scientists in one or more population-based disciplines e.g. epidemiology, biostatistics, health statistics, demography or sociology.

All Regional Grants Interviewing Committees dealing with population-based or field studies should have a majority of members from the population-based disciplines. Some of the HRC1s Special Purpose activities - but not the funds should be transferred to a new Health Development committee. Any Reference Laboratory functions should be the function of the National Health and Medical Research Division's Pathology Laboratories Branch and survey activities such as the Market Basket Survey should be transferred to the National Centre for Health statistics. Peer review of investigator-initiated research should continue. A full spectrum of investigator-initiated activities spanning laboratory biomedical research through clinical research to population-based research and funded through projects grants, programs, units and institutional grants as well as fellowships should be maintained - but a dedicated amount of at least - 15% and preferably higher, , and rising to about a third of all research over the next decade should be population-based. The total - HRC budget is quite inadequate given Australia's resources. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The annual budget for a renamed Health Research Endowment Fund should be increased promptly to \\$70.0 million annually. If the HRC does not chose to change its name and - more , importantly, the composition of its membership and its Regional Grants Interviewing Committees, and set targets for population-based research, then 15% of its annual funds should be shifted to the Health Development Endowment Fund (see below) i.e. about \\$10.0 million. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ A Health development Committee (HDC) should be established with a dedicated Health Development Endowment Fund. The HDC should operate in a similar fashion to the HRC except that the majority of its members and at least six of the "researchers" should come from the public health and : population-based disciplines. Rigorous peer review with I external assessment and Regional Grants Review Committees should be used. This dedicated endowment fund should incorporate the I RADGAC funds, the AIDS, alcohoIism and other related funds. The focus should be problem-oriented, developmental projects ! submitted in response to "Requests for Proposals". The total amount might be in the order of \\$15.0 million annually. 

### IX. Tropical Health, Medicine and Diseases
__RECOMMENDATION:__ The Queensland Health Department should establish an Epidemiological Surveillance Unit based at the Townsville General Hospital or in the Commonwealth Pathology Laboratory. This Unit should be funded by The Queensland Health Department and/or a tax on hotel rooms and/or meals with the case argued by the Tourist Commission for the area. This Unit would be responsible for determining the incidence and distribution of tropical and marine-based illnesses that afflict both the local population and tourists in North Queensland and it should develop evidence of the extent of these problems as well as clues to their causation and control.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The. Queensland Institute of Medical Research might change its name to the Queensland Institute of Health Research . - and should be designated a major centre for tropical disease research with expanded block institutional support to permit employment of additional staff (possibly transferred from the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine). A Satellite Unit of QIMR should be created and located at The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences in Townsville to undertake research into marine-based diseases. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The James Cook University Graduate School of Tropical Veterinary Sciences at Townsville should be expanded by strengthening immunology and epidemiology. These funds should be provided through the university administration from the CTEC and a high priority should be given to the development of this outstanding school which already enjoys a superb international reputation.

### X. Management Training
There are a variety of university schools and colleges of advanced education which train individuals for jobs in hospitals. The nature of their training is said to place major emphasis on running institutions such a hospitals more efficiently, in contrast to an emphasis on how these institutions relate to other components of the health care system, especially community health and general practitioner services, and on how to best organise services. It seems inevitable that Australia will follow the patterns in other developed (and developing) countries and organise health care resources within vertically integrated and balanced systems rather than along the lines of horizontal cartels. There will be a need, therefore, to train highly skilled managers who understand "regionalisation" in both its functional and geographic aspects. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The Australian Graduate School of Management at 0 the University of New South Wales should be asked to add a Health Services Module to its MBA courses, perhaps staffed in part from the Westmead Hospital's Department of Community Health {or the new Research centre of epidemiology and population Health at ANU). Special scholarships or fellowships with stipends at competitive levels should be provided to attract young clinicians and other able non-physicians such as economists who might otherwise be attracted to the private sector. The fellowships should be awarded through an annual national competition and about ten might be offered annually at levels of at least \\$30,000 a year provided through the Health Development Committee and its endowment fund. About $50,000 annually might be needed to support the Health Services Module. Those receiving fellowships might well be expected to spend two years in the Public Service, either at Commonwealth or State levels for every year of fellowship support received. The initial budget which would be part of the HDC's total fellowship budget and might be about \\$350,000 a year. 

### XI. Towards One National Accomplishment
As Australia moves towards its bicentennial, there should be at least one health improvement initiative that will be seen to have been successful. This can be achieved if the country sets its mind to it. Seat-belt legislation and compliance with the law are a case in point; Australia has led the world. If the following recommendation emerges from the Better Health Commission report so much to the good. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ Australia should set as its bicentennial goal, in connection with this entire Bicentennial Health Initiative, the reduction of alcohol-related traffic accidents and deaths by 30%. This is a do-able task. The cost ok this initiative might be \\$l million annually

### Conceptual Framework
[Return to Table of Contents](#back)

1.1 Some argue that "medicine" is a subset of "public health" and others the opposite. Health and disease states are parts of a continuum. The fact that suffering individuals label their problems with one set of terms and that health professionals use other terms has little to do with the underlying realities experienced by those doing the suffering and footing the bill. 

1.2 Health and illness arise in the home, the neighbourhood, at school and in the work-place. They are influenced by genes, food, a wide range of biological, physical, social and behavioural exposures and experiences to which individuals or groups of individuals respond. Inter-personal strife and faulty machines, together with exposure to a great diversity of micro-organisms, all evoke emotional, physiological and immunological responses which in turn find expressions as predispositions, illnesses and disabilities for which different concepts and terms are employed.

1.3 There is a continuum between the experiencing of amorphous symptoms and functional limitations to the most florid expressions of highly specific "diseases" managed in technologically elaborate hospitals. Another continuum exists from support systems in the community, through primary and secondary care to so-called tertiary care in large university medical centres. Similarly there is a continuum for the study of all these manifestations from the wet laboratory of the biomedical scientist to the clinician and on to the population or the community and vice versa.

1.4 Problems are studied where there is the best chance of finding an answer. These studies should have a bearing in the short-term or the long-term on health problems experienced by the public which finances the whole health care apparatus. One part of these three spectrums is not 'good or 'bad', 'right 'wrong', 'hard' or 'soft' - all have their place and all deserve attention. Just as the biomedical and clinical perspectives now permeate the health care enterprise, so should the population perspective. 

1.5 Australia needs not just more "public health" workers but more "population-based" thanking throughout the health sciences and the health services (1). That is what Australia's Bicentennial Health Initiative should be all about.

### Problems and Issues
[Return to Table of Contents](#back)

2.1 The history of political, professional and scientific efforts to improve the health of the public i.e. all the people, is replete with widely divergent views on both the goals and the strategies to achieve them. To some the goals are determined by successive re-definitions of what has become socially and politically unacceptable, to others they are determined by a set of risk aversion strategies for perceived threats to the population, and for yet another group they are concerned with the optimum attainment of individual and collective potential for "well-being" to be measured in often unstated or abstract fashions.  

2.2 It is not surprising, therefore, to find the fields of "public health" and "tropical health" characterised by mixtures of ideology, science, and ad hoc responses to assorted, often ephemeral, crises in health related matters. Confusion of both goals and objectives pervades the whole field - research, education and service. Nor is it little wonder that a wide diversity of definitions, priorities, practices and aspirations , characterising educational, research and service institutions is to be found under the banners of "public health" and "tropical health". Clinicians too are serving the public's needs for i better health and medical care and we could do well to proceed under the presumption that they are committed to making significant contributions.

2.3 This Review has heard multiple definitions of "public  health" and of "tropical health". They encompass such laudable goals as exterminating cockroaches, on the one hand, to preventing nuclear war, on the other. Some boundaries would restrict the field to the monitoring of water and food sources and supplies, immunising children and the surveillance of communicable diseases. Others would extend the boundaries to include leadership and the capacity to determine the numbers and mixes of health professionals, institutions and services, development of guidelines for the organisation of services, and creation of methods for evaluating the impact of technology and services in relationship to their costs and to measures of the perceived needs of the public.

2.4 It is strongly argued, for example, that "public health" is a discipline, characterised by multidisciplinary interactions" or that it is a "combination of sciences, skills and beliefs". That many disciplines can contribute to improving the health of the public seems clear. The notion that "public health" per se is a "single discipline" is not widely accepted by most members of the broader scientific and health care enterprise. Nor are many of the goals and objectives of health departments clearly understood by some elements in the community, particularly those who seek services to meet perceived needs, or who attempt' to "exercise political will in the interests of change. Although it should be recognized that, in many settings, the values and objectives of community representatives have more in common with many of the staff in health departments than they do with, say, those of many hospital specialists, this is Ear from universally true. 

2.5 f Seventy years ago the Rockefeller Foundation, on the basis of a hastily drafted document, decided to embark on a new approach to training medical officers of health who would undertake strategies for the control of environmentally based diseases and for the immunisation of populations against selected communicable diseases. To this endeavour was added a research component based on the German Institutes of iene(2). The Foundation underwrote the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and replicated it in London, Toronto, Tokyo and numerous other cities in Europe, Asia and Latin America. An alternative model in which the Harvard School of Medicine would provide training in a broadly defined field of "preventive medicine" for physicians, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would train sanitary engineers and others in the physical and natural sciences to work on "public health problems'' was rejected. The history of both the intellectual and political basis for this decision has only recently been explored and is yet to be fully evaluated and published(j)

2.6 The net effect of this seventy-year old experiment has been that schools of medicine were deprived of the population-based perspective. In turn, cl inicians learned little or nothing about the precursors of illnesses which people experience within their natural habitats where they live, eat, work, struggle for a better life and die. Nor do clinicians learn nuch about their patients1 lives after leaving the hospital.

2.7 Separate schools of public health have operated apart from the mainstream of scientific medicine which has flourished over the last two generations. However, these Schools have been largely responsible for. developing the principal scientific and quantitative methods for understanding group phenomena in populations and communities. Epidemiology, literally "the study of that which is upon the people" was developed originally by the leading university clinicians of London in the middle of the 19th Century. As a consequence of the separation of "public health" from "medicine", epidemiology is now largely the province of schools of public health, and it has only recently been re-introduced into medical schools and especially into cl inical departments where it originated. This presents many academics and clinicians with unfamiliar perspectives, methods and quesrions, and yet these are really only extensions of the scientific method to the study of groups of populations and communities, in addition to te Reople9 srudy i.e. of molecular and cellular phenomena and of individual patienrs.

2.8 To all these considerations one must add a revolution of rising expectations. Equal access to health care has become a - - - right and all essential services are assured to the entire population. It follows that governments and their hzalth departments find themselves collecting and dispersing vast sums of money directed at "improving the public's health". Increasingly they are called upon not only to account for the money but to say what has been accomplished and whether the people's needs are being met. This notion of overall accountability and its correlates of populat ion-based measurements and evaluations may appear quaint to some. Both those with a narrow view of "public health" as being concerned . essentially with risks or threats from environmentally-based diseases, and those trained in clinical medicine with the mind-set that "doctors know best" are just beginning to appreciate the revolution which is under way.

2.9 Sir William Petty, a young physician and Oxford don, generally acknowledged to be the father of demography, economics, epidemiology, statistics and survey methods raised these matters three centuries ago in a brilliant treatise entitled "Political Arithmetitk". The central argument that accountability tor money spent in relationship to measurable benefits is essential for service professions and institutions remains unchanged. Our contemporary methods and technology for approaching these problems and the issues have made Petty's injunctions infinitely more practical.

2.10 One thing seems clear. On a global basis, a shift is under way from control of the entire health sciences and health care system from the supply side to control from the demand - side. No longer can medical schools in most jurisdictions expect to train doctors to do "what they wishu, nGr can health departments ignore behaviourally determined disorders, or the health impacts of such environmental factors as food additives or visual and noise pollution. Whether it is through the World Health Organisation's "Health for All by the Year ZOO0 " strategy, through private enterprise's reorganision of the health care arrangements (in the United States initiated by four huge investor-owned corporations along the lines recommended f2r Britain in the Dawson Report of 1922(4)) or through the exercise of political will resulting in the remarkable rjanges in the Cuban health system during the past three decades, there can be little doubt that a "sea change" towards meeting the perceived needs of the people - the "market" to use commercial terminology - is underway.

2.11 It seems probable that Australia, as it approaches its Bicentennial, will wish to determine its own future in relationship to its own needs, its own "market" and its own "public" health problems. As an aid to considering possible future institutional arrangements, ten generic problems have been identified in the course of this Review:

2.11.1 There appears to be no organised national - forum in which the diverse, and increasingly complex, issues - surrounding policies and practices that 'bear 'on health and disease can be critically examined and debated and from which the results can be widely disseminated to the public, politicians and professions. 

2.11.2 There is no co-ordinated system of National Health Statistics capable of aggregation and analysis at all organisational and jurisdictional levels. Australia is behind other Western Countries in developing its national health statistics. There are serious impediments to doing analytical studies, to identifying risk groups, to undertaking small area comparisons and to assessing the impact of services, resource allocations and re-imbursement schemes in relationship to measures of need and demand.

2.11.3 Only small proportions of the - best young minds in, for example, medicine, sociology, economics, anthropology, demography, statistics, biology, engineering and, especially, managemem are recruited and retained for careers in public health. 

2.11.4 There is strong emphasis in many settings on teaching about "public healthf' and ''tropical health'' rhrough courses of lectures, rather than on learnin through small g rouP problem-solvinq, an ddependenc investigation. There is a related emphasis on trainin rather than on education, as usually understoo at r: e best universities and research institutes

2.11.5 There is perceived to be inordinate exercise of power and an inadequate accountability for the resources used by the practicing clinical physicians within the health enterprise of the country.

2.11.6 The continuum that exists from the molecular and cellular through the individual or patient to the o ulation or communit is not appreciated fully f$%il hry'sdsciences institutioqs and their faculties. In research, education and servlce it. may be argued that one is not more or less important than the other two, nor is any one of the three, hard or soft. It is not the site of the study that matte s but rather the credibmt and utilit of the findings. Examples -ern-solving init i tut ional st rategles accompanied by investigator-ini tiated studies within this broad paradigm are to be found at QIMR, the Menzies School of Health Research, the James Cook University Graduate School of Veterinary Tropical Science, the National Acoustic Laboratories, rhe Australian Radiation Laboratory, the Australian Institute of biarine Sciences and the Walrer and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research

2.11.7 The relative merits of decentralisat ion versus centralisation of research and education in the many 2- disciplines contributing to improvement of the public' s health are widely discussed. There is strong pressure - to  trengthen resources, particularly for the MPH degree, and for research in at least one of rhe universitites in all the State capitals and in the nation's capital. There are also arguments Ear concentrating more resources in one national institution. In summary, it is a matter of balancing a national focus with regional requirements in contaract to the present arrangements which are considered to be distorted. 

2.11.8 There are wide differences of opinion about the adequacy of the funding, the quality of research proposals, the methods of distributing funds, and the focus of responsibility and accountability for all forms of research and enquiry into the broad range of factors that impact on health and disease. The concerns extend across a wide spectrum of sites and equally wide spectrum of skills and commitments. 

2.11.9 There is a perceived dominance of the reductioiiist, mechanistic, so-called "medical" model, of health and disease, especially on the "supply" side of the healrh -- - care enterprise. This is contrasted with the "ps~chosocial-bi~logical'~ model which recognises the existence of networks ot causal factors in the genesis of healthy and unhealthy states and one appreciated by a growing proportion of those concerned with the "demand" side. Some argue that conceptually, clinical medicine is now where Newtonian physics was before it was superseded by quantum physics.

2.11.10 There is said to be only modest appreciation Ly the public and the health professions of the pervasive beneficial and positive influences of the effect and the Hawthorne effect (picneere w Australia's own Professor Elton Mayo at Harvard University). Together these two ubiquitous therapeutic modalities are said to account for 40 to 60 percent of the benefits associated with nearly all intervent ions directed at both individuals and communities. It is argued that the placebo and Hawthorne effects may be the most powerful healing agents currently -available and that they should be called by their right names and re- imbursed appropriately.
