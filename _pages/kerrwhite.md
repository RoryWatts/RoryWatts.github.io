The "Kerr White report" is formally known as the 'Independent review of research and educational requirements for public health and tropical health in Australia'. It is an important report which has influenced the development of public health in Australia, but unfortunately can be quite tricky to obtain. I decided to convert the majority of the report's content to text for those who might find it useful.

I do not own the rights to this publication. 
Currently, there is a link to the PDF of this report [available here](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/C66647AAB9871405CA257BF000209A71/$File/pherp-review-1986.pdf). 

N.B. Formatting is my own. There may be mistakes, which are either the fault of my own, or the fault of the pdf reader which interpreted the scanned images.

## Summary of Recommendations 
[Return to Table of Contents](#back)

### I. Australia's Bicentennial Health Initiative

As Australia prepares to celebrate its bicentennial, this should be an opportune time to build on past accomplishments in order to create a "healthier" future. The following set of recommendations should be seen as a "package". Some of the initiatives are already reflected in the priorities and initial re-organisation of the Commonwealth Department of Health, others have been undertaken by several universities and health departments in the States, still others have been discussed at conferences and in more detail by smaller groups and a few have been canvassed for a decade or more in various forums. In many ways there is little new in the essential elements. What will be new is their introduction as a collection of related initiatives designed to move Australia's health enterprise into the twenty-first century. 

### II. Australian Academy of Health

__RECOMMENDATION:__ To elevate the level of debate and provide timely consideration for the country's national health problems an Australian Academy of Health should be established. A Task Force should be appointed to draft legislation procedures and a budget for creating a national membership body of about 150-200 individuals, forty percent would be non-health professionals. A full-time President and staff would work with an unpaid Governing Council, Committees and Task Forces to examine and make recommendations on a wide variety of health problems and issues. The initial budget might be $1.5 million annually.

### III. Australian Institute of Health

This innovative approach towards information-based policy analysis and decision-making is highly commendable. It has been given, however, an unusually broad mandate, inadequately defined responsibilities and ambiguous relationships to the Commonwealth and State Governments and to universities, varying time frames for reporting, and a current agenda inherited from disparate predecessor bodies. The substantial conceptual advances represented by the creation of the AIH should now be clarified and strengthened and to that end, the following three recommendations are made

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The AIH should be strengthened by giving it a more clearly defined role as the substantial policy analysis and "intelligence" group working directly for the Minister and Secretary. It should be in a staff, not a line, position and would work closely with the entities proposed in the next two recommendations. It should have a Director and staff of perhaps 6 to 8 professionals with appropriate support personnel. The initial budget should be $0.5 million annually.

### IV. National Centre for Health Statistics

__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Centre for Health Statistics to provide leadership and co-ordination of compatible and comparable Health Statistics Systems for the entire country should be established by legislation. The Centre would promulgate standards, conventions, terms, definitions, minimum data sets and classifications and should contract with States, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and survey organisations for data collection. It is especially important that cost, charges and financial statistics be linked with those measuring needs, resources, use and outcomes. The NCHS would publish substantive and methodological reports including an annual report entitled "Health Australia: 19--". The Centre should be, and be seen to be non-political, under the Commonwealth Department of Health for administrative purposes only, and serving the entire nation by reporting to the Australian Health Services Council. The initial budget might be $2.0 million annually. 

### V. National Centre for Technology and Health Services Assessment

__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Centre 'for Technology and Health Services Assessment should be established by, legislation. It would be responsible for developing methods and undertaking studies designed to assess the outcome of health services of all types including both individual and collective interventions. It would conduct health services research including cost-effectiveness studies of both new and current technologies, utilization of health, hospital and pharmaceutical services of all types. Particular attention should be paid to low-cost, high-volume diagnostic tests, procedures and prescriptions as well as to capital-intensive technologies. The Centre would not be responsible for testing the safety and toxicity of drugs but it would be responsible for studies of their patterns of use and their cost-effectiveness. The Centre should be, and be seen to be non-political, under the Commonwealth Department of Health for administrative purposes only, and serving the entire nation by reporting to the Australian Health Services Council. The initial annual budget might be $1.5 million annually. 

### VI. School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine

The consensus of the great majority of submissions and opinions expressed during interviews, and at the Sydney Seminar is that the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine has out lived its usefulness. Multiple reviews over the past decade or more have been unable to help the school to define its mission,recruit permanent leadership or have an observable impact on contemporary health affairs in the country. Dual masters for funding, leadership and performance, ambiguous organisational relationships, rapid turnover of faculty, conflicts between goal-oriented and investigator-initiated research, incompatible mixes of students, use of the courses primarily for purposes of job advancement, uncoordinated lectures by visiting office holders, variable academic standards, inability to at tract many young students, an uneven research output, uneasy tension with the medical faculty, limited administrative support from the medical faculty, discordance between school priorities and perceived national problems are among the many manifestations said to be associated with the widespread perception of inadequacy. It is a sad litany and there is no point in attempting to apportion blame. 

There are first-rate people in the school and their dedication  during a protracted period of uncertainty is applauded. The talents of these highly skilled and committed individuals constitute a valuable national resource and opportunities should. be provided for them as soon as possible in new venues where a fresh start is to be made. There are occasions in t.he lives of institutions and organisations when revitalisation and renewal are only possible under new auspices. 

RECOMMENDATION: All the funds and resources currently devoted to the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine should be redeployed for new institutional and organisational initiatives that further the goals of- public and tropical health throughout Australia.
