## awards 
- Staff Reward and Recognition Award, 2020 
    - He always goes above and beyond what he is asked to do, completes his work to the highest standard, and often provides suggestions that value adds to students and other stakeholders. These suggestions inevitably increase his workload, but he is always ready to take on more. 
He has an unflappable attitude, even when the pressure is on and even when we all didn’t see the last minute, unexpected deadline coming. We have wondered before if his spirit animal is the duck – calm on the surface and paddling furiously underneath the surface to keep things moving along.
He exhibits great enthusiasm in all he does, and his collegiality makes him a valued team member. A lesser person would have been overwhelmed and stressed by all the metaphorical plates needed to be kept spinning in the air, but Rory always manages to keep it all going with an abundance of energy.
