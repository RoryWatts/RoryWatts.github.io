## It's been 22 years since Tina Arena's 'Burn' was released

It's fantastic, but we clearly don't respect Ms. Arena or the song very much. In the song, she asks a series of questions, yet I know of no-one who has answered them. They don't strike me as particularly rhetorical, so let's answer them.

Firstly, let's have a look at the lyrics which are, indisputably, questions.

> Do you wanna be a poet and write <br>
> Do you wanna be an actor up in lights <br>
> Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love <br>
> Do you wanna travel the world <br>
> Do you wanna be a diver for pearls <br>
> Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above... <br>
> <br>
> Are you gonna be a gambler and deal <br>
> Are you gonna be a doctor and heal <br>
> Or go to heaven and touch God's face <br>
> Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps <br>
> Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps <br>
> Or an angel under grace <br>

(Credit to `LyricFind` for the lyrics, although I think a few question marks are missing)

## How many questions are there?

For those who answered twelve? I'd disagree. The key is in the sentences beginning with `or`. I think she actually asks three sets of questions, one with six choices, and two questions with three choices each.

| Question One | Question Two | Question  Three |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do you wanna be a poet and write? | Are you gonna be a gambler and deal? | Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps? |
| Do you wanna be an actor up in lights? | Are you gonna be a doctor and heal? | Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps? |
| Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love? | Or go to heaven and touch God's face? | Or an angel under grace? |
| Do you wanna travel the world? | | |
| Do you wanna be a diver for pearls? | | |
| Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above? | | |
