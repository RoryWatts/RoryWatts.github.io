I'm a PhD candidate at The University of Western Australia, where I'm trying to answer the question: *do we have enough people doing public health work?* I also consult with the World Health Organization, where I provide guidance on health economics and tool-building. I have a Bachelor in English Literature, a Bachelor of Medical Science in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and a Master of Public Health. In my spare time I sing, read, swim, and program.
