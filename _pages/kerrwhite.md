The "Kerr White report" is formally known as the 'Independent review of research and educational requirements for public health and tropical health in Australia'. It is an important report which has influenced the development of public health in Australia, but unfortunately can be quite tricky to obtain. I decided to convert the majority of the report's content to text for those who might find it useful.

I do not own the rights to this publication. 
Currently, there is a link to the PDF of this report [available here](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/C66647AAB9871405CA257BF000209A71/$File/pherp-review-1986.pdf). 

N.B. Formatting is my own. There may be mistakes, which are either the fault of my own, or the fault of the pdf reader which interpreted the scanned images.

## Summary of Recommendations 
[Return to Table of Contents](#back)

### I. Australia's Bicentennial Health Initiative
As Australia prepares to celebrate its bicentennial, this should be an opportune time to build on past accomplishments in order to create a "healthier" future. The following set of recommendations should be seen as a "package". Some of the initiatives are already reflected in the priorities and initial re-organisation of the Commonwealth Department of Health, others have been undertaken by several universities and health departments in the States, still others have been discussed at conferences and in more detail by smaller groups and a few have been canvassed for a decade or more in various forums. In many ways there is little new in the essential elements. What will be new is their introduction as a collection of related initiatives designed to move Australia's health enterprise into the twenty-first century. 

### II. Australian Academy of Health
__RECOMMENDATION:__ To elevate the level of debate and provide timely consideration for the country's national health problems an Australian Academy of Health should be established. A Task Force should be appointed to draft legislation procedures and a budget for creating a national membership body of about 150-200 individuals, forty percent would be non-health professionals. A full-time President and staff would work with an unpaid Governing Council, Committees and Task Forces to examine and make recommendations on a wide variety of health problems and issues. The initial budget might be \$1.5 million annually.

### III. Australian Institute of Health
This innovative approach towards information-based policy analysis and decision-making is highly commendable. It has been given, however, an unusually broad mandate, inadequately defined responsibilities and ambiguous relationships to the Commonwealth and State Governments and to universities, varying time frames for reporting, and a current agenda inherited from disparate predecessor bodies. The substantial conceptual advances represented by the creation of the AIH should now be clarified and strengthened and to that end, the following three recommendations are made

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The AIH should be strengthened by giving it a more clearly defined role as the substantial policy analysis and "intelligence" group working directly for the Minister and Secretary. It should be in a staff, not a line, position and would work closely with the entities proposed in the next two recommendations. It should have a Director and staff of perhaps 6 to 8 professionals with appropriate support personnel. The initial budget should be \$0.5 million annually.

### IV. National Centre for Health Statistics
__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Centre for Health Statistics to provide leadership and co-ordination of compatible and comparable Health Statistics Systems for the entire country should be established by legislation. The Centre would promulgate standards, conventions, terms, definitions, minimum data sets and classifications and should contract with States, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and survey organisations for data collection. It is especially important that cost, charges and financial statistics be linked with those measuring needs, resources, use and outcomes. The NCHS would publish substantive and methodological reports including an annual report entitled "Health Australia: 19--". The Centre should be, and be seen to be non-political, under the Commonwealth Department of Health for administrative purposes only, and serving the entire nation by reporting to the Australian Health Services Council. The initial budget might be \$2.0 million annually. 

### V. National Centre for Technology and Health Services Assessment
__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Centre 'for Technology and Health Services Assessment should be established by, legislation. It would be responsible for developing methods and undertaking studies designed to assess the outcome of health services of all types including both individual and collective interventions. It would conduct health services research including cost-effectiveness studies of both new and current technologies, utilization of health, hospital and pharmaceutical services of all types. Particular attention should be paid to low-cost, high-volume diagnostic tests, procedures and prescriptions as well as to capital-intensive technologies. The Centre would not be responsible for testing the safety and toxicity of drugs but it would be responsible for studies of their patterns of use and their cost-effectiveness. The Centre should be, and be seen to be non-political, under the Commonwealth Department of Health for administrative purposes only, and serving the entire nation by reporting to the Australian Health Services Council. The initial annual budget might be \$1.5 million annually. 

### VI. School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine
The consensus of the great majority of submissions and opinions expressed during interviews, and at the Sydney Seminar is that the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine has out lived its usefulness. Multiple reviews over the past decade or more have been unable to help the school to define its mission,recruit permanent leadership or have an observable impact on contemporary health affairs in the country. Dual masters for funding, leadership and performance, ambiguous organisational relationships, rapid turnover of faculty, conflicts between goal-oriented and investigator-initiated research, incompatible mixes of students, use of the courses primarily for purposes of job advancement, uncoordinated lectures by visiting office holders, variable academic standards, inability to at tract many young students, an uneven research output, uneasy tension with the medical faculty, limited administrative support from the medical faculty, discordance between school priorities and perceived national problems are among the many manifestations said to be associated with the widespread perception of inadequacy. It is a sad litany and there is no point in attempting to apportion blame. 

There are first-rate people in the school and their dedication  during a protracted period of uncertainty is applauded. The talents of these highly skilled and committed individuals constitute a valuable national resource and opportunities should. be provided for them as soon as possible in new venues where a fresh start is to be made. There are occasions in t.he lives of institutions and organisations when revitalisation and renewal are only possible under new auspices. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ All the funds and resources currently devoted to the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine should be redeployed for new institutional and organisational initiatives that further the goals of- public and tropical health throughout Australia. 

### VII. Institutional Arrangements for Public Health Education
__RECOMMENDATION:__ A new National Research Centre for Epidemiology  and Population Health should be established at the Australian National University. A director who is preferably an epidemiologist with wet laboratory and/or clinical experience and managerial expertise should be chosen by the University on the basis of an international competition. The initial disciplines to be incLuded on the Centre's Faculty in addition to epidemiology should include health statistics, sociology, economics, nutrition and toxicology. The principal task of this research centre should be the graduate education to M.Sc and Ph.D levels of academic faculty in t.he major disciplines germane to public and tropical health especially epidemiology. An annual budget of about \$2 million should be transferred from the Commonwealth Department of Health t.0 the ANU vote and this should be provided for six years. The initial budget would probably include about. \$1 million for a new building. The director and an initial staff of eight. to ten faculty should have five-year term appointments to be followed by an external review and further renewals or tenure as circumstances warrant. ANU should incorporate the Research Centre's budget in it.s global budget after the initial six year period. Additional research funds should be sought from the NHEMRC's, Health Research Committee and its Health Development Committee, (see below) private foundations and voluntary agencies.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ At least. \$4.0 million annually should be
provided by the Commonwealth department of Health t.o endow or fund chairs, senior lecturers' and lecturer positions principally at three universities that provide both strong undergraduate and postgraduate education in public health or related fields, have recently had infusions of new funds or support and are prepared to give an MPH or preferably M.Sc or Ph.D degrees. The universities proposed initially are The University of Adelaide, The University of Sydney's new initiative at Westmead Hospital and The University of Newcastle.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ At least \$1.0 million annually should be provided by the Commonwealth Department of Health for salaries of faculty and support personnel at universities (other than those nominated above) and colleges of advanced education that provide strong undergraduate and post-graduate education in public health or related fields.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ About 50 scholarships should be provided annually through a national competition arranged and assessed by the Health Development Committee (see below) of the NHGMRC. These should have a value of about \$30,000 each annually and they would be used for support of training in the various disciplines germane to public health, including management. About \$2.0 million annually might be needed for this initiative.

### VIII. National Health and Medical Research Council
__RECOMMENDATION:__ The Medical Research Committee should change its title to reflect what it says it does and become the Health Research Committee (HRC). Of its seventeen members, it should have at least four of its total membership and at least two of its eight "medical researchers", who are experienced and competent scientists in one or more population-based disciplines e.g. epidemiology, biostatistics, health statistics, demography or sociology.

All Regional Grants Interviewing Committees dealing with population-based or field studies should have a majority of members from the population-based disciplines. Some of the HRC1s Special Purpose activities - but not the funds should be transferred to a new Health Development committee. Any Reference Laboratory functions should be the function of the National Health and Medical Research Division's Pathology Laboratories Branch and survey activities such as the Market Basket Survey should be transferred to the National Centre for Health statistics. Peer review of investigator-initiated research should continue. A full spectrum of investigator-initiated activities spanning laboratory biomedical research through clinical research to population-based research and funded through projects grants, programs, units and institutional grants as well as fellowships should be maintained - but a dedicated amount of at least - 15% and preferably higher, , and rising to about a third of all research over the next decade should be population-based. The total - HRC budget is quite inadequate given Australia's resources. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The annual budget for a renamed Health Research Endowment Fund should be increased promptly to \$70.0 million annually. If the HRC does not chose to change its name and - more , importantly, the composition of its membership and its Regional Grants Interviewing Committees, and set targets for population-based research, then 15% of its annual funds should be shifted to the Health Development Endowment Fund (see below) i.e. about \$10.0 million. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ A Health development Committee (HDC) should be established with a dedicated Health Development Endowment Fund. The HDC should operate in a similar fashion to the HRC except that the majority of its members and at least six of the "researchers" should come from the public health and : population-based disciplines. Rigorous peer review with I external assessment and Regional Grants Review Committees should be used. This dedicated endowment fund should incorporate the I RADGAC funds, the AIDS, alcohoIism and other related funds. The focus should be problem-oriented, developmental projects ! submitted in response to "Requests for Proposals". The total amount might be in the order of \$15.0 million annually. 

### IX. Tropical Health, Medicine and Diseases
__RECOMMENDATION:__ The Queensland Health Department should establish an Epidemiological Surveillance Unit based at the Townsville General Hospital or in the Commonwealth Pathology Laboratory. This Unit should be funded by The Queensland Health Department and/or a tax on hotel rooms and/or meals with the case argued by the Tourist Commission for the area. This Unit would be responsible for determining the incidence and distribution of tropical and marine-based illnesses that afflict both the local population and tourists in North Queensland and it should develop evidence of the extent of these problems as well as clues to their causation and control.

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The. Queensland Institute of Medical Research might change its name to the Queensland Institute of Health Research . - and should be designated a major centre for tropical disease research with expanded block institutional support to permit employment of additional staff (possibly transferred from the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine). A Satellite Unit of QIMR should be created and located at The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences in Townsville to undertake research into marine-based diseases. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The James Cook University Graduate School of Tropical Veterinary Sciences at Townsville should be expanded by strengthening immunology and epidemiology. These funds should be provided through the university administration from the CTEC and a high priority should be given to the development of this outstanding school which already enjoys a superb international reputation.

### X. Management Training
There are a variety of university schools and colleges of advanced education which train individuals for jobs in hospitals. The nature of their training is said to place major emphasis on running institutions such a hospitals more efficiently, in contrast to an emphasis on how these institutions relate to other components of the health care system, especially community health and general practitioner services, and on how to best organise services. It seems inevitable that Australia will follow the patterns in other developed (and developing) countries and organise health care resources within vertically integrated and balanced systems rather than along the lines of horizontal cartels. There will be a need, therefore, to train highly skilled managers who understand "regionalisation" in both its functional and geographic aspects. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ The Australian Graduate School of Management at 0 the University of New South Wales should be asked to add a Health Services Module to its MBA courses, perhaps staffed in part from the Westmead Hospital's Department of Community Health {or the new Research centre of epidemiology and population Health at ANU). Special scholarships or fellowships with stipends at competitive levels should be provided to attract young clinicians and other able non-physicians such as economists who might otherwise be attracted to the private sector. The fellowships should be awarded through an annual national competition and about ten might be offered annually at levels of at least \$30,000 a year provided through the Health Development Committee and its endowment fund. About $50,000 annually might be needed to support the Health Services Module. Those receiving fellowships might well be expected to spend two years in the Public Service, either at Commonwealth or State levels for every year of fellowship support received. The initial budget which would be part of the HDC's total fellowship budget and might be about \$350,000 a year. 

### XI. Towards One National Accomplishment
As Australia moves towards its bicentennial, there should be at least one health improvement initiative that will be seen to have been successful. This can be achieved if the country sets j its mind to it. Seat-belt legislation and compliance with the law are a case in point; Australia has led the world. If the following recommendation emerges from the Better Health Commission report so much to the good. 

__RECOMMENDATION:__ Australia should set as its bicentennial goal, in connection with this entire Bicentennial Health Initiative, the reduction of alcohol-related traffic accidents and deaths by 30%. This is a do-able task. The cost ok this initiative might be \$l million annually
