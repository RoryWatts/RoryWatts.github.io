I'm an early career researcher with an interest in health economics, labour economics and global health. 

I also have a wide range of methodological interests, and in the past have built:
- decision analytic models for health technology assessments
- supervised machine learning models for natural language processing 
- regression models 
- webscrapers 
- websites 
- databases

I previously worked for the World Health Organization in Geneva where I built models, and assisted in coordinating projects. I am now a PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia whilst teaching undergraduates and postgraduates, and assisting with health economics research.

I have degrees in Medical Science, Public Health and English Literature. In my spare time I make music, sing, and read.
