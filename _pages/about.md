I'm an early career researcher with an interest in health economics and global health. 
Currently, I am a PhD candidate at The University of Western Australia with teaching and consulting commitments.

I also have a wide range of methodological interests, and in the past have built:
- decision analytic models for health technology assessments
- supervised machine learning models for natural language processing 
- regression models 
- webscrapers 
- websites 
- databases

I previously worked for the World Health Organization in Geneva where I built models, and assisted in coordinating projects. I have degrees in Medical Science, Public Health and English Literature. In my spare time I make music, sing, and read.
